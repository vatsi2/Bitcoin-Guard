Implements cold‑storage best practices (hardware, paper, air‑gapped) to safeguard private keys offline, leveraging air‑gapped systems and hardware‑wallet integration for institutional‑grade protection

3. On‑Chain Intelligence
Surfaces Glassnode‑powered whale metrics—such as Supply per Whale and accumulation trends—to inform timing of large trades and portfolio adjustments

4. Yield Optimization
Automates deployment of capital into high‑yield opportunities, from tokenized private credit products to DeFi “yield‑stacking” strategies, democratizing returns previously reserved for institutional credit markets

5. Advanced Trading & OTC
Facilitates limit, market, TWAP/VWAP, and OTC orders with algorithmic execution, plus “lazy trading” concepts (TWAMM) to minimize market impact on large orders

6. Tax & Compliance Automation
Integrates with ZenLedger and similar tools to produce audit‑ready reports, auto‑fill IRS forms, and support DeFi/NFT transactions, simplifying end‑to‑end crypto tax filings
