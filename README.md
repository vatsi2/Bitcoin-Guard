# HodlDesk Royen Corp
## üî• **Description**  
We propose ‚ÄúHodlDesk‚Äù, a cross-platform macOS/Windows desktop application tailored for high-net-worth Bitcoin holders (10‚ÄØBTC+). It combines real-time multi-source portfolio aggregation, on-chain analytics, cold-storage key management, yield optimization across CeFi/DeFi, tax and compliance tooling, and institutional-grade OTC integration‚Äîall within a highly secure Electron-based framework. By addressing whale-specific pain points (fragmented data, security risks, manual yield strategies, and lack of compliance features), HodlDesk will meet an underserved demand and drive substantial downloads among sophisticated Bitcoin investors.
